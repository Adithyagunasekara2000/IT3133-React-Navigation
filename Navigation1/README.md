# IT3133-React-Navigation-Day6
<h3>Why We Use navigate in React</h3>
We use navigate from react-router-dom to programmatically change the URL and navigate to different routes based on user actions or certain conditions. This allows for more dynamic and interactive navigation in our applications.
<h3>Key components</h3>
<li>BrowserRouter as Router: This renames BrowserRouter to Router for convenience. It is the main component that enables routing in app.
<li>Routes: This component is used to group all your routes.
<li>Route: This component defines a single route. It matches a URL path to a component.
<li>Link and NavLink: These are used to create navigation links. Link is for basic navigation, while NavLink provides additional styling for the active link.
